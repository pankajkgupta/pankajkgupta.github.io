What classical neuroscience result would you revisit with a BMI? (Neural Interfaces for Neurobiological Insights)	Talk	nini	Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, 25 Howland Street, London, W1T 4JG	2020-10-09	London, UK	https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/events/annual-symposium-neural-interfaces-neurobiological-insights	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage neural activity to control external effectors – from cursors on two-dimensional screens to artificial limbs with many degrees of freedom. Best known for their use in neuroprosthetics, BMIs provide a powerful tool for basic neurobiological research by enabling experimental control over otherwise inaccessible neural and behavioural parameters.
Real-time Neural Feedback of Mesoscale Cortical GCaMP6 Signals Using Raspberry-Pi	Talk	ccnsv2	Online	2021-05-17	Online	https://www.crowdcast.io/e/ccnsv2/15	The Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS) was created following the mass cancellations and postponements of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new, entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee presentations.

NapHack – Hack your naps for better productivity!	Hackathon	nathacks2021	natHACKS - NeurAlbertaTech's inaugural brain-computer interface hackathon	2021-08-02	Alberta, Canada	https://devpost.com/software/naphack	In these hectic times, power naps are a necessity to increase productivity with the crucial parts of effective napping include a relaxing sleep and waking up at the right sleep-state. To address this need, we are developing NapHack, an application that uses auditory neurofeedback to assist sleeping in a relaxed state of mind and monitoring sleep states in real-time to wake-up the user at a predetermined sleep-state. The python packages we use are muse-lsl, audiostream, numpy, mne, pickle, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, and pyedflib. We used muse-lsl to stream real-time EEG data (Fs=256Hz) from 4 electrodes of MUSE-S to a PC. The data is band-pass filtered from 1-40Hz (IIR filter) and z-scored. Power in delta (1-3Hz) and alpha (8-12Hz) bands is computed and their ratio is inversely mapped to the frequency of an audio-tone, used as neurofeedback. Higher alpha-to-delta ratio, indicating a relaxed state, would increasingly correspond to lower audio frequencies, enabling relaxed sleep. Additionally, preprocessed data is used to estimate spectral features (FFT), classify sleep states, and monitor them in real-time using a pre-trained SVM classifier. After the desired nap time and upon reaching a predetermined sleep state, an alarm is set-off to wake-up the user. The SVM classifier is trained to classify 6 sleep-states using EEG data acquired from publicly available CAP Sleep Database, and provides a test accuracy of 57% (Chance=16.7% ). Through a novel focus on optimizing naps, NapHack is paving the way for the future of napping -- choose health, choose wellness and choose NapHack!
LOUDy Bird - to fulfill the therapeutic needs of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients	Hackathon	loudybird	Brain-Tech 2021	2021-08-14	Vancouver, Canada	https://devpost.com/software/loud	Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, causing tremor, impairment in movement, balance, speech, and swallowing difficulty, leading to degradation of patients’ quality of life. Research shows that specific exercise programs such as movement and speech exercise can significantly ameliorate PD symptoms and slow down disease progression. However, these exercise routines are often physically challenging and mentally exhausting for PD patients which would discourage them from completing such routines. Our project aims to make these exercise routines a lot more fun while tailoring them to each patients’ specific needs and abilities. We showcase this by implementing a clinically-effective speech improvement program named LSVT LOUD in a voice-controlled version of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird - we called it LOUDy Bird. Three main components of the program- 1) increasing speech volume, 2) widen voice frequency range, and 3) improving speech accuracy, are all smoothly incorporated into the game mechanics so that the patient can enjoy all the clinical benefits of the exercise while having fun. Game difficulty and parameter choice can be flexibly adapted to each patient’s ability and progress to motivate them to complete the exercise routine regularly. The game is flexible to incorporate other forms of therapeutic exercise programs using different inputs in future development. Upon consent, detailed reports of performance and improvements would be available for care providers and for future research. We see this as a great example of combining technology and scientific research to sustainably help patients with rehabilitation and improve their quality of life.
